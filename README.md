# 📦 2.5D Demo – Public Domain Compliance Checklist

A lightweight 2.5D prototype built exclusively with **CC0 / Public Domain** assets and self‑created placeholders.  
All geometry uses Unreal Engine primitives; all textures and materials are either CC0 or authored in‑house.  
No licensed Marketplace content, no branded silhouettes, no trademarked shapes.

## Core Goals
- Clean 2.5D side‑scrolling setup  
- Abstract “cargo block” aesthetic  
- Fully redistributable demo  
- Modular, low‑stress development workflow  

## To‑Do (Shortform)
- Create fresh Unreal project (no Marketplace imports)  
- Lock camera to 2.5D rail  
- Build level using cubes/planes only  
- Author CC0/self‑made materials  
- Add text overlays (“Dest: Unknown”, etc.)  
- Implement basic movement + jump  
- Add simple physics block interaction  
- Remove unused assets before packaging  
- Include `/docs/licenses.md` with CC0 sources
